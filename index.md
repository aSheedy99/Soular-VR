Soular VR is an creative environment built for Meta Quest 2 that allows players to shape entire worlds with their own hands! The project was inspired by creative sandbox games like <i> Minecraft </i> ,  <i> Spore </i> and <i> the Sims </i> . This page will explore my contribution as a Techincal Developer to the project, formatted in a chronological order and ending with a short reflection. Soular was made as the final project for Goldsmith's MSc XR course. As well as myself, the piece was created by Seonjeong Park (Technical), Ebba Liepe (Art) and Nicalia ThompSon (Art). Soular was built in Unity using Meta's OVR Plugin.

## Technical Overview

### Player Gestures

My main task for this project was creating a flexible and performant system capable of recording hand gestures as recognisable inputs using Meta's OVR Plugin for Unity. The following code is essentially the final function used for this (although it has been simplified for ease of reading):

## User Journey

With the aim of being a creative sandbox for players to experience as they wish, with no guiding narrative or strict flow of content, the user journey of Soular is fairly open. That being said, there is still a general user journey we had in mind when designing Soular that most users will likely follow:
